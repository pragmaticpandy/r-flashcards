    "word": "Palimpsest",
    "pronunciation": "PAL-imp-sest",
    "definition": "A manuscript or surface where earlier writing has been scraped away and written over — but traces of the original remain beneath.",
    "origin": "From Greek palimpsēstos (\"scraped again\"). Originally literal — medieval monks reused expensive parchment. Now used metaphorically across humanities to describe anything layered with partially erased histories: cities, texts, identities, landscapes.",
    "example": "\"The city itself is a palimpsest — beneath the gleaming development, traces of displacement and Indigenous presence remain legible to those who know how to read them.\"",

  {
    "word": "Aporia",
    "pronunciation": "uh-POR-ee-uh",
    "definition": "A state of puzzlement or an irresolvable internal contradiction in a text, argument, or concept.",
    "origin": "From Greek ἀπορία — literally \"without passage.\" Socrates was famous for leading interlocutors into aporia. In deconstruction, Derrida uses it to describe points where a text undermines its own logic. It's that productive dead-end — not a failure of thinking, but where the interesting thinking starts.",
    "example": "\"The essay traces an aporia at the heart of liberal universalism: its claim to include everyone depends on excluding those who reject its terms.\"",

    "word": "Lacuna",
    "pronunciation": "luh-KOO-nuh",
    "definition": "A gap, blank, or missing portion — especially in a manuscript, text, body of evidence, or theoretical framework. Plural: lacunae.",
    "origin": "From Latin for \"pool\" or \"pit.\" Used everywhere in the humanities — history, literary criticism, archival studies, philosophy. When a scholar says \"there's a lacuna in the literature,\" they mean nobody has addressed that gap yet.",
    "example": "\"The colonial archive presents a significant lacuna: the voices of the colonized are largely absent, preserved only in the margins of administrative records.\"",

    "word": "Chiasmus",
    "pronunciation": "ky-AZ-mus",
    "definition": "A rhetorical figure in which two clauses mirror each other with inverted syntax: AB → BA.",
    "origin": "From Greek khiasmos (crossing), named for the letter chi (X). The most famous example: \"Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country.\" Once you learn to spot it, it's everywhere — from Biblical verse to academic arguments.",
    "example": "\"The essay's chiastic structure — moving from individual trauma to collective memory, then from collective silence back to individual voice — gave the argument an elegant symmetry.\"",

  {
    "word": "Interpellation",
    "pronunciation": "in-ter-pell-AY-shun",
    "definition": "The process by which ideology \"hails\" or addresses individuals, turning them into subjects who recognize themselves within its framework.",
    "origin": "Coined by Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser (1970). The classic example: a police officer shouts \"Hey, you!\" — by turning around, you accept you are being addressed. You've been interpellated. Now used across cultural studies, gender theory, and critical race theory.",
    "example": "\"Butler extends Althusser's theory of interpellation to argue that gender itself is performatively constituted through repeated acts of recognition and misrecognition.\"",

  {
    "word": "Jouissance",
    "pronunciation": "zhwee-SAHNS",
    "definition": "An intense, transgressive pleasure or bliss that exceeds ordinary enjoyment — often disruptive, overwhelming, or even painful.",
    "origin": "From French — literally \"enjoyment\" or \"orgasm,\" but in critical theory it means something far more specific. Lacan distinguished it from simple plaisir (regulated, comfortable pleasure): jouissance is the excessive, destabilizing kind that pushes past the boundaries of what the subject can contain. Barthes picked it up in The Pleasure of the Text to describe ecstatic, almost violent rupture — not cozy satisfaction, but the text that undoes you. Now used across psychoanalytic theory, literary criticism, feminist theory, and cultural studies.",
    "example": "\"Barthes distinguishes between texts of plaisir — which comfort and confirm — and texts of jouissance, which unsettle the reader's assumptions and produce a pleasure inseparable from disorientation.\"",

  {
    "word": "Aufhebung",
    "pronunciation": "OWF-hay-boong",
    "definition": "Simultaneously to cancel, to preserve, and to elevate — a single act that negates something while keeping what's essential and raising it to a higher level.",
    "origin": "From Hegel's German — famously \"untranslatable\" because no English word captures all three meanings at once. Often rendered as \"sublation,\" which nobody uses in normal speech. This is the engine of Hegel's dialectic: thesis and antithesis don't just clash — one aufhebt the other, meaning it's overcome but also incorporated into something new. Think of it less as destruction and more as composting: the old form dies, but its substance feeds what grows next. Shows up constantly in philosophy, critical theory, political thought, and even psychoanalytic writing (Žižek loves it).",
    "example": "\"The movement from individual grief to collective mourning performs a kind of Aufhebung — personal loss is not erased but sublated into a shared political consciousness that transforms its meaning.\"",

  {
    "word": "Object Idea",
    "pronunciation": "OB-jekt eye-DEE-uh",
    "definition": "A mental representation of a thing, as opposed to the thing itself — the version of an object that exists in your head.",
    "origin": "From John Locke's empiricist epistemology. For Locke, an \"idea\" is whatever the mind perceives in itself — any thought, image, or concept. When you see a chair, you don't directly experience the chair; you experience your idea of it. Hume sharpened this into \"impressions\" (vivid, immediate experience) and \"ideas\" (faded copies). Berkeley took it further: if all we ever access are ideas, maybe there are no objects independent of them at all.",
    "example": "\"The grief she carries isn't about the person anymore — it's about her object idea of them, a version she constructed and now can't let go of.\"",

  {
    "word": "Eschatology",
    "pronunciation": "es-kuh-TOL-uh-jee",
    "definition": "The branch of thought concerned with the final events of history, the ultimate destiny of humanity, or the end of things — whether religious, philosophical, or political.",
    "origin": "From Greek eskhatos (\"last\") + logos (\"study\"). Originally a theological concept — the study of death, judgment, heaven, hell, the Second Coming. But it's migrated far beyond religion: Marx's classless society is an eschatological vision, Fukuyama's \"end of history\" is secular eschatology, and climate discourse often carries eschatological undertones. Whenever a thinker posits a final state or ultimate reckoning, they're doing eschatology.",
    "example": "\"Benjamin's 'Theses on the Philosophy of History' recasts revolutionary politics in eschatological terms — redemption arrives not through progress but through a messianic rupture in the continuum of time.\"",

  {
    "word": "Catachresis",
    "pronunciation": "cat-uh-KREE-sis",
    "definition": "The forced or improper use of a word — extending a term beyond its original meaning, often because no proper word exists.",
    "origin": "From Greek katakhrēsis (\"misuse\"). Classical rhetoric treated it as an error: mixed metaphors, words stretched where they don't belong (\"the leg of the table,\" \"the face of a cliff\"). But postcolonial and deconstructive theory flipped it into a strategy. Spivak uses catachresis to describe how colonized peoples deliberately seize and repurpose the master's concepts — democracy, rights, nationhood — knowing those terms were never meant for them, and using them anyway.",
    "example": "\"Her reading of the Indian constitution performs a catachresis of Enlightenment liberalism — claiming rights discourse for subjects it was designed to exclude, and in doing so, exposing the gap between its universalist promises and its particular origins.\"",

  {
    "word": "Heteroglossia",
    "pronunciation": "het-er-oh-GLOSS-ee-uh",
    "definition": "The simultaneous presence of multiple voices, languages, or registers within a single text, utterance, or social space.",
    "origin": "From Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin (1930s) — Greek heteros (\"other\") + glōssa (\"tongue\"). Bakhtin argued that language is never neutral or unified: every word carries traces of who else has used it, in what contexts, with what intentions. A novel doesn't speak in one voice — it's a collision of the author's language, characters' dialects, professional jargon, street speech, and borrowed styles, all jostling against each other. He contrasted this with monoglossia — the illusion of a single authoritative voice. For Bakhtin, heteroglossia isn't just a feature of good novels — it's the condition of language itself. Now everywhere: literary criticism, sociolinguistics, anthropology, postcolonial studies.",
    "example": "\"The courtroom transcript reveals a striking heteroglossia — legal formalism, the defendant's vernacular, the interpreter's flattening translations, and the judge's performative authority all inhabit the same text, each pulling meaning in different directions.\"",

    "word": "Phronesis",
    "pronunciation": "froh-NAY-sis",
    "definition": "Practical wisdom — the ability to discern the right course of action in particular, concrete situations.",
    "origin": "From Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. He distinguished three kinds of knowledge: episteme (theoretical, universal truths), techne (craft, technical know-how), and phronesis — the hardest to teach because it can't be reduced to rules. It's judgment: knowing what to do when, for whom, and why, in a way that no manual can fully capture. Gadamer, Arendt, and MacIntyre all built on it. Now central to debates in education, nursing, social work, and political theory about what kinds of knowledge actually matter.",
    "example": "\"She argued that policy expertise alone is insufficient — what frontline workers possess is a form of phronesis, a situated moral knowledge that no amount of evidence-based training can replicate.\"",

  {
    "word": "Habitus",
    "pronunciation": "HAB-ih-tus",
    "definition": "The deeply ingrained dispositions, tastes, and ways of perceiving the world that are shaped by one's social position — embodied without being consciously chosen.",
    "origin": "From sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. Habitus is why a person raised working-class and a person raised upper-middle-class can walk into the same room and instinctively hold their bodies differently, order different things, laugh at different jokes — not because they're performing class, but because class has literally written itself into their nervous systems. It's not habit (too deliberate) and it's not instinct (too biological). It's the social made bodily: structured by your history, but structuring your future choices without you noticing. Bourdieu paired it with \"field\" (the social arena) and \"capital\" (economic, cultural, social) — together they explain how inequality reproduces itself even when nobody's explicitly enforcing it. Now foundational across sociology, anthropology, education, and cultural studies.",
    "example": "\"Her habitus — formed in the rural evangelical community she'd left a decade ago — still surfaced in small, involuntary ways: the deference to authority in academic meetings, the discomfort with self-promotion, the instinct to read intellectual confidence as arrogance.\"",

    "word": "Prolepsis",
    "pronunciation": "proh-LEP-sis",
    "definition": "The anticipation of something future — either addressing an objection before it's raised (rhetoric), or narrating an event before it chronologically occurs (narratology).",
    "origin": "From Greek prolēpsis (\"anticipation\"). It does double duty across the humanities. In rhetoric, it's the move of preemptively voicing your opponent's best counterargument and defusing it — Aristotle catalogued it, but every good essayist uses it instinctively. In narrative theory (Genette), it's the flash-forward: a moment where the text leaps ahead of its own timeline. The two senses aren't as separate as they seem — both involve a text reaching into its own future.",
    "example": "\"The opening line — 'Many years later, as he faced the firing squad' — is a prolepsis that restructures the entire narrative: we read every subsequent scene of Buendía's youth knowing it moves toward a violence already announced.\"",

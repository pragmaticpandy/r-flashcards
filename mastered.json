    "word": "Nerd Sniped",

    "definition": "Getting so intellectually captivated by a problem that you can't help but drop everything to solve it — even if it's completely irrelevant to what you were doing.",
    "origin": "From xkcd comic #356 by Randall Munroe, where a physicist gets literally stopped in traffic because someone poses an interesting physics problem. The term spread through tech and academic culture as shorthand for weaponized intellectual curiosity.",
    "example": "\"Someone mentioned an unsolved resistor network problem at dinner and he went silent for twenty minutes. Total nerd snipe.\"",

    "word": "Object Idea",
    "pronunciation": "OB-jekt eye-DEE-uh",
    "definition": "A mental representation of a thing, as opposed to the thing itself — the version of an object that exists in your head.",
    "origin": "From John Locke's empiricist epistemology. For Locke, an \"idea\" is whatever the mind perceives in itself — any thought, image, or concept. When you see a chair, you don't directly experience the chair; you experience your idea of it. Hume sharpened this into \"impressions\" (vivid, immediate experience) and \"ideas\" (faded copies). Berkeley took it further: if all we ever access are ideas, maybe there are no objects independent of them at all.",
    "example": "\"The grief she carries isn't about the person anymore — it's about her object idea of them, a version she constructed and now can't let go of.\"",

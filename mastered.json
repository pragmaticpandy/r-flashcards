    "definition": "Getting so intellectually captivated by a problem that you can't help but drop everything to solve it — even if it's completely irrelevant to what you were doing.",
    "origin": "From xkcd comic #356 by Randall Munroe, where a physicist gets literally stopped in traffic because someone poses an interesting physics problem. The term spread through tech and academic culture as shorthand for weaponized intellectual curiosity.",
    "example": "\"Someone mentioned an unsolved resistor network problem at dinner and he went silent for twenty minutes. Total nerd snipe.\"",

    "word": "Diaphanēs",
    "pronunciation": "dee-AH-fah-nays",
    "definition": "The quality of a medium that allows things to appear — not just transparency, but the condition that makes seeing possible.",
    "origin": "From Greek dia (through) + phainein (to show). In Aristotle's De Anima, the diaphanous isn't the object or the light — it's the medium (like air or water) that exists as a potentiality, activated by light, bringing objects into visibility. It's the thing you look through without noticing, that nonetheless makes the looking work.",
    "example": "\"Mann's sanatorium functions as a diaphanous space — seemingly neutral, yet it is precisely what renders the ideological tensions between his characters visible.\"",
